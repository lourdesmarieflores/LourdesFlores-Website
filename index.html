        <div class="subheading mb-5">BiochemistryðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently in my 4th year at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) studying biochemistry with a concentration in the medical sciences. Classes have included general chemistry, biology, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and multiple biochemistry courses with labs. <br><br>

        Throughout my experience at UCR, I've participated in the biochemistry club, the Trio Scholars organization, and the Golden Key International Society. Upon taking an interest in the medical field, my first job experience consisted of working as a Home Health Aide for the summer. During this job, I provided care and assistance for patients with activities of daily living including: bathing, dressing, grooming, and feeding. I prepared special meals and diets, provided transportation, and accounted for the patient's needs and overall comfort. This was a truly heart-warming and rewarding experience as I was able to connect with patientâ€™s of all ages from my community. After enjoying the feeling of helping others, I signed up to volunteer with the American Red Cross where I was a Blood Donor Ambassador in charge of checking in donors and assisting in the organization of blood drives, a Disaster Action Team Member responsible for responding to emergency calls in need of Red Cross assistance, and a Shelter associate as well as a feeding associate in times of big emergencies. During the summer after my third year, I joined the Future Physician Leaders Program under the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine (UCR SOM). I worked with a team to design and implement a community health project about heart attack prevention for the community which consisted of multiple presentations, a brochure, website, flyers, and social media pages all in both English and Spanish. The research we conducted from this program allowed for my team to be selected to present what we found at the UCR SOM Quality Improvement Conference. As I continued on my educational path, I began looking for ways to gain more research experience. I was selected as a U-SPARC paid research fellow where I worked in a microtubule dynamics research lab measuring rapid turnover of growth. The goal of the project is to understand structures undergoing rapid changes during the cell cycle and compare the different cell phases. These experiences have helped me gain a better perspective on my passions and the type of career I choose to pursue post graduation.<br><br>

        Outside of my education, I enjoy many hobbies such as running, playing tennis, and hiking. Physical health is very important to me, and is a big part of what I advocated for over the summer to those who are at risk for high blood pressure or a heart attack. Even as little as going for a walk can be greatly beneficial to oneâ€™s health, and it is important to help our community in any way that we can.
